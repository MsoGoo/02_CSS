        normal flow
            web is a Multilayer layout structure
            Client view is a bird's-eye view
            The bottom layer is called the normal flow
            All elements we created are defaulted to be arranged in normal flow
            An element has two main states
                - in normal flow
                - out of normal flow

            
            features of elements in normal flow
                - block elements
                    - take up a line | no matter the size of width
                    - The default width is the width of the parent element
                    - The default height is the height occupied by the inner child elements
                - inline elements
                    - won't take up a line, the size is itself size
                    - arrange from left to right. if the current line cannot accommodate all the context, switch to the next line.
                    - The default width and height of inline elements are the same as the content size
